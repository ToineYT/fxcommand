# Fx Command Deckboard

This plugin helps FiveM users send various commands through Deckboard. It is inspired by the StreamDeck plugin found here: [EggRP/fxcommands](https://github.com/EggRP/fxcommands).

## Usage

1. Add a new button with the action `FxCommand->Send`.
2. In the "Command" field, enter your command without the `/`.

**Examples:** To use the command `/e crossarms`, enter `e crossarms` in the input field. Similarly, you can use any commands that are available in the chat through this plugin.
